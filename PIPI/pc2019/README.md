StericNet: a Powerful Tool for Time Series Deep Learning Problems

A large number network structures have been invented for computer vision, NLP or speech deep learning problems in these years, and some have been taken into time series problems without considering its special features. One of those is relationship among axes or channels of data; another is the relationship among sub-sequences. In this paper, we present a new deep learning network structure named as StericNet for modelling steric relationships both on the time direction and on the channel direction. It can be seen that network structures from other research fields can improve the performance a lot if special features of time series are modeled or considered in a network.

This paper shows that StericNet cannot be only used to solve typical classification problems in which there are long sequences and one prediction for a whole sequence is output, but also for the CinC 2019 challenge problem in which the length of a sequence varies a lot and one prediction for every step of a sequence is output.
