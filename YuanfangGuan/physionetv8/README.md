# Instructions

The Python script `get_sepsis_score.py` makes predictions on the input data.

To run this script, install the NumPy Python package and run

        python get_sepsis_score.py training.zip predictions.zip

which takes `training.zip` (a zip file of the training data files, which is available on the PhysioNet website) as input and returns `predictions.zip` (a zip file of the prediction files) as output.
