The Python script `get_sepsis_score.py` makes predictions on the input data.

To run this script, run

        python get_sepsis_score.py input.psv output.psv

which takes a text file `input.psv` as input and returns a text file `output.psv` as output.

The input files are provided in a training database available on the PhysioNet website, and the format for the output files is described on the PhysioNet website.
