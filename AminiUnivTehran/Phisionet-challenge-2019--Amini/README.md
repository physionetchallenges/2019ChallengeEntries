Instructions
 
The R script get_sepsis_score.R makes sepsis predictions on clinical time-series data. The R script driver.R is a helper script that loads the data, calls get_sepsis_score.R, and saves the predictions.

Please add your prediction code to the function get_sepsis_score in the get_sepsis_score.R script. Please do not change the driver.R script or the format of the inputs and outputs for the get_sepsis_score function -- or we will be unable to evaluate your submission.

You can run your prediction code on a patient cohort by running

    Rscript driver.R input_directory output_directory
where input_directory contains input data files and output_directory contains output prediction files. The input files are provided in a training database available on the PhysioNet website, and the format for the output files is described on the PhysioNet website.
